to get feedback early. This will help give you context for your contributions,

Our communication channels are:

   conversations related to our project. This resource can be searched for old
   discussions.

### Contribution Expectations

We are deeply grateful for all contributions, big or small. Please note that
while we do our best to engage, we may not always have time to support every
contribution. To keep the repository maintainable, we kindly ask that you start
a discussion or issue before submitting a pull request. Submissions made
without prior engagement are welcome but may be declined or ignored at our
discretion.
