The Routing Application for Programmed Integration of Discharge (RAPID) is a
river network routing model. Given external inflow to rivers, this model can
compute the flow of water everywhere in river networks made out of many
thousands of reaches.

> **Note:** While the underlying RAPID routing methodology is highly mature and
> battle-tested in operational environments, this specific Python 3 codebase
> (RAPID2) is currently in Beta (v2.0.0b3) and under active development.

## Quick Start

This guide provides a quick way to get started with our project. Please see the
[RAPID website][URL_RAPHUB] for a more comprehensive information.

### Requirements

- `git`
- `python3.11`
- `pip3`

### Setup Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/c-h-david/rapid2
cd rapid2
pip install .
```

### Run Instructions

```bash
rapid2 --namelist nml_Sandbox_TR.yml
```

### Usage Examples

Below is an example of what `nml_Sandbox_TR.yml` includes:

```yaml
---
Qex_ncf: './input/Sandbox/Qex_Sandbox_19700101_19700110_TR.nc4'
Q00_ncf: './input/Sandbox/Q00_Sandbox_19700101_19700110_TR.nc4'

con_pqt: './input/Sandbox/con_Sandbox.parquet'
kpr_pqt: './input/Sandbox/kpr_Sandbox.parquet'
xpr_pqt: './input/Sandbox/xpr_Sandbox.parquet'

bas_pqt: './input/Sandbox/bas_Sandbox_ascend.parquet'

IS_dtR: 900

Qou_ncf: './output/Sandbox/Qou_Sandbox_19700101_19700110_TR_tst.nc4'
Qfi_ncf: './output/Sandbox/Qfi_Sandbox_19700101_19700110_TR_tst.nc4'
```

### Build Instructions

If you would like to build an Operating System to run RAPID2 from scratch,
we recommend Debian-based distributions and software packages for the
Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) are summarized in
[`requirements.apt`][URL_REQAPT]
to be installed with `apt-get`. All packages can be installed at once
using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
     $(grep -v -E '(^#|^$)' requirements.apt)
```

> Alternatively, one may install the APT packages listed in
> [`requirements.apt`][URL_REQAPT]
> one by one, for example:
>
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3.11
> ```

Also make sure that `python3` points to `python3.11`:

```bash
sudo rm -f /usr/bin/python3
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3.11 /usr/bin/python3
```

If you would like to run in a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv $HOME/venv
export PATH=$HOME/venv/bin:$PATH
```
